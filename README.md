The source code for ECCV 2022 paper "Vibration-based Uncertainty Estimation for Learning from Limited Supervision"

The main functions for semi-supervised learning, active learning and one-bit supervision are respectively in "main_ssl", "main_al" and "main_1bit" files. 
The codes for active selection methods are in the file "annotation_functions". 
The parameter setting should follow the corresponding baseline method, e.g., Mean Teacher.
